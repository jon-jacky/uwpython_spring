<b>Summary:</b> This course is a will primarily be a
studio/lab/clinic, where students (working individually or in groups)
will do a capstone project of their own choosing that applies and
consolidates what they learned in the first two courses.  
</p>

<p>
Each meeting will also include a presentation by instructors, guests,
or students.  See the provisional <a href="#schedule">schedule</a>.
The prepared presentation, including questions and discussion, will be
limited to one hour per class.
</p>

<p>
Two hours per class will be devoted to project work.  An instructor
will meet with each student for twenty minutes in turn (each student
working in a group will get the full twenty minutes).  Each twenty
minute appointment will be scheduled at least a week in advance.
Students should prepare questions or discussion points for their
appointments in advance.  Students will present their projects to the
class on the last day.
