distribution of applications - for end users, not other Python developers

problem? 
    distributing applications

what are the options?
    bare script 
    private python installation
        distributed somehow
        or on a network share! (good when working at large companies)
            install "for me" on Windows, not "all users"
    generate a stand-alone executable
        includes Python, stdlib, your modules, binary dependencies
        options
            cx_freeze
            pyInstaller 
            py2exe
            py2app

demo
    punchline first, run command, run installer
    walk through py2exe config
    show output files
    walk through InnoSetup config
    show config generator
    run installer again, show output files

gotchas
    beware, you're entering the land of fiddly crap - especially with binary dependencies
    run time environment differences
        paths
        dll loading/discovery
        tempfiles
        "one file" modes add complication and new failure modes
            often extract to a temp file - can cause runtime issues
            py2exe uses clever LoadLibrary tricks - doesn't work with some dlls
    dependencies missing
    console and GUI apps are different - need to decide up front which your app is. 
        mostly, what happens to stdout and stderr

recommendations?
    my experience might not be the best - probably worth evaluating other options

cx_Freeze - active
http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/
    Windows, OS X, Linux
    Python 2.3 - 3.2
    Only Win/Linux choice for Python 3.x
    Zipped eggs OK (probably)

pyInstaller - active
http://www.pyinstaller.org/
    Windows, OS X, Linux
    Python 2.2 - 2.7
    Zipped eggs OK

py2exe - stalled, but useful
http://www.py2exe.org/
http://www.py2exe.org/old/ - better intro docs than you'll find on the wiki
    Windows only
    Python 2.x
    last release in 2008
    stable and full-featured (many specialized windows features supported: versions, windows services, etc)
    works great for Windows services
    no zipped eggs (easy_install makes these by default, use -Z to unzip)

py2app - active
http://packages.python.org/py2app/
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2app/
https://bitbucket.org/ronaldoussoren/py2app/
    OS X only
    Python 2.5 - 3.2
    Zipped eggs OK

bbfreeze - active - fork of cx_freeze
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bbfreeze/
    Windows and Linux
    Python 2.4 - 2.7
    Zipped eggs OK

    
gui wrapper around most of the tools:
http://code.google.com/p/gui2exe/
    "GUI2Exe is a Graphical User Interface frontend to all the "executable builders" available for the Python programming language. It can be used to build standalone Windows executables, Linux applications and Mac OS application bundles and plugins starting from Python scripts."
