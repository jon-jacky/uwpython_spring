% talking points for week 8 lecture on PyPI, distutils, ...

Lots of tools, rather bewildering: distutils, setuptools, pip, easy_install

What problems do they solve?

Distribution/installing python modules/packages is easy - just
post/download the .py files - they just work, usually do not require
any special installation procedure.

Review:

module - any .py file
package - directory containing modules, including at least  __init__.py 

You can make any dir of .py files into a package by adding an __init__.py
(which can be empty).

importing a package, importing modules from a package

PYTHONPATH and site-packages

All this is built into python, doesn't require any special libraries or tools

So - why distutils etc ?

Two issues, two kinds of tools:

distributing code: distutils, setuptools, ...
finding/installing code: pip, easy_install, ...
